                        <p>Although this one might sound a bit cliché nowadays, I could't leave outside. That's one thing I really believe, we can't build great things
                            without it, you can talent, networking, money, but without hard work, you won't go hard. Because of that one of
                            my mantras is, Hard Work Pays Of. To prove it, of the many things that I could be doing on a Sunday morning, I
                            here working on this project.</p>

                        <p>Another cliché, but this one is new to me. I was curious since a kid, that kind of kid that keeps asking why. I
                            tried to learn how to code 2 times and give up, I didn't really give it a try. And then I thought it would never
                            be for me until I read the book Mindset. It definitely changed my mindset to a growth one, where we can learn
                            everything we want, acquires any ability I desired.</p>

                        <p>Although I don't have a huge coding background, work in hospitality teaches many things. Before to complain to a
                            waiter about the food is taking to long in a restaurant, I think, the might be understaffed in the kitchen, the
                            delivery might be late, the waiter could be under training. Those jobs taught me how to truly listening to
                            people, and then be able to help them. And never criticise without a solution.</p>

                        <p>Yes, unfortunately, I'm not perfect, yet. As I like to learn by doing, after learning a new thing and try to
                            apply it as soon as possible, trying to follow the principle if you are going to fail, fail fast. It should be a
                            good thing, but sometimes, I go to fast to the execution and forget the planing part, which is important as
                            well.</p>

                    <p>It's always hard to define yourself, especially when you are always trying to improve. I mean, today I'm not the same
                        person I was yesterday, and hopefully tomorrow I'll be a better version of me. Since I started my journey as a
                        Software Developer I saw that there is always new to learn, and the more I learn, the more I realized that there is
                        much more to learn. Keeping that in mind I have a mantra, get 1% better every day, doing it for one year and you get
                        378% better. 378% better as a Software Developer, as a student, as a husband, as a human being. It is not always
                        easy, but if were easy, it wouldn't be fun, it wouldn't make me a Googler.
