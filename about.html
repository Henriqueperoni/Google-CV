                <p>Although this one might sound a bit cliché nowadays, I could't leave outsideAlthough this one might sound a bit
                    cliché nowadays, I couldn't leave outside. That's one thing I really believe, we can't build great things
                    without it, you can talent, networking, money, but without hard work, you won't go hard. Because of that one of
                    my mantras is, Hard Work Pays Of. To prove it, of the many things that I could be doing on a Sunday morning, I
                    here working on this project.</p>

                <p>Another cliché, but this one is new to me. I was curious since a kid, that kind of kid that keeps asking why. I
                    tried to learn how to code 2 times and give up, I didn't really give it a try. And then I thought it would never
                    be for me until I read the book Mindset. It definitely changed my mindset to a growth one, where we can learn
                    everything we want, acquires any ability I desired.</p>

                <p>Although I don't have a huge coding background, work in hospitality teaches many things. Before to complain to a
                    waiter about the food is taking to long in a restaurant, I think, the might be understaffed in the kitchen, the
                    delivery might be late, the waiter could be under training. Those jobs taught me how to truly listening to
                    people, and then be able to help them. And never criticise without a solution.</p>

                <p>To build a great team, I believe have to be trust between them, and it can't be built without integrity. Honesty,
                    in my opinion, shouldn't be a quality, I mean, that's the minimum you hope from a person.</p>

                <p>Yes, unfortunately, I'm not perfect, yet. As I like to learn by doing, after learning a new thing and try to
                    apply it as soon as possible, trying to follow the principle if you are going to fail, fail fast. It should be a
                    good thing, but sometimes, I go to fast to the execution and forget the planing part, which is important as
                    well.</p>
