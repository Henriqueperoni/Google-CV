# Personal Portfolio Project

## Created for the Google Software Development Apprenticeship.

This project was created to demonstrate my deep interest in the be chosen for the Google Software Development Apprenticeship, and become a Googler.

In the project, I didn't try to recreate Google, the best search engine in the world. It's a frontend project, I decided to keep the website simples due to limited time(I wanted to apply for the Google Apprenticeship as soon as possible). For this reason, sometimes I used images instead of properly code. The idea was demonstrated some of my abilities, and more about me, things that weren't included in my CV.

### Responsiveness
Although the website does is responsive, I opted to focus on mobile and desktop(the most used ones) view due to limited time as explained above.
